# Groceries App

---

Project Summary:
I am going to the store and I have a recipe in mind and I know I am going to need Garlic Powder but I think I have it at home. I didn't...

Goals:
Use Grocery store open API to keep track of the thing I have so I don't buy the same stuff a dozen times.

It should be easy to add and remove items that are bought and used.

Things should have a shelf life.

Future goals/Ideas
- Notifications when things expire
- auto grocery list
